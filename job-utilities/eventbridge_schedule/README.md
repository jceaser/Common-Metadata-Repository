`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` - Needed for boto3 to communicate with AWS
`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` - Needed for boto3 to communicate with AWS
`AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` - Needed for boto3 to communicate with AWS
`AWS_PROFILE` (optional) - With properly configured AWS profile, you can sepcify that profile and forgo setting the other AWS variables
`JOBS_FILE` (optional) - Specifies a file with job details, defaults to '../job-details.json'
